### This project generates random paragraphs text based on number of paragraphs the user inputs.
### Please note as I have trouble reloading changes on github I usually create many dummy projects and test them out on dummy repositories before uploading my final one. After tutorial I did learn why i was having trouble updating my changes through cmder and now i should be able to work within one repository moving forward.
